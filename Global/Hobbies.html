<h3>HOBBIES AND FREE TIME</h3>
<p>In my leisure time, I engage in a diverse range of activities that both 
    stimulate and inspire me. I am an avid reader and writer, particularly 
    drawn to literature on business strategies and engineering production 
    processes. This blend of knowledge enriches my understanding of both 
    fields, allowing me to approach challenges with a multifaceted 
    perspective. Creativity is an integral part of my life, which I express 
    through painting. My portfolio, showcased on my website 
    www.dipintisutelamoderni.webnode.it, captures my passion for art and 
    the beauty of modern expressionism. Complementing my personal 
    interests, I dedicate time to volunteering with the Red Cross, contributing 
    to meaningful initiatives that support and uplift communities. </p>
